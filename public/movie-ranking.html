<h1>Movies Nandini Would Recommend</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sapta Sagaralu Dhaati - Side A</h3>
<p>Its a very emotional movie where a middle class boy to make his girlfriend wishes to become true does one thing which costs him very badly.</p>
<h3>Dasara</h3>
<p>A film which i cried the most and the direction of each scene was superb and it left an immense impression on me after watching the interval.</p>
<h3>Tiger Nageshwar Rao</h3>
<p>The movie is all about a thief who does things for their people and they dont even realize his value.And when they realize things its too late.</p>
